# Code Refractor Assignment: Homework-1

Refactored previous code to make edits and clean up some of the semantics on the HTML. Applied semantic changes to CSS and made effort to organize similar code more consicely.

HTML changes: Changed title to make it relate to content/insitution providing the content... Made semantic changes to more define each section/property in order to locate in CSS more easily - new sections include nav, main, aside, footer tags... Added alt tags to the img components to describe content if link breaks... Added ID tag to first image in main tag, matching 'Search Engine Optimization' href. Allows page to shift to that specific content... Cleaned up image IDs to reduce excess verbiage

CSS changes: Made sure any tag changes were translated to the style page... Reduced lines by grouping like tags and removing redundant attributes (reduced line count from 200 to 118)... Moved #meeting image src to the html page in order to keep formatting consistent throughout - *functional in CSS, but may be overlooked if changes are required*... Adjusted color scale on span tag so attribute rendered more clearly on page
